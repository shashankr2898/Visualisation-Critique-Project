# 🎥 Visualization Critique Presentation: Indian Test Cricket Records

## 📌 About This Project

This repository showcases my **Visualization Critique Presentation** for the module **BEMM461: Analytical and Visualization Techniques**, part of my Master's in **Business Analytics** at the University of Exeter. The presentation focuses on critically analyzing a data visualization of the Indian Test Cricket team's performance from **1932 to 2015**, sourced from Reddit.

## 🏏 Chosen Visualization

- **Title:** "India Test Records"
- **Purpose:** To depict the performance of the Indian cricket team in Test matches across different eras, distinguishing between home and away performances.
- **Audience:** Cricket enthusiasts, analysts, and fans interested in the evolution of India's Test cricket performance under various conditions and captaincies.

## 🎯 Key Highlights

### **Strengths**
- **Preattentive Processing:** Effective use of color hues (blue for victories, red for defeats) to quickly convey outcomes.
- **Narrative Design:** Author-driven visualization offering a detailed chronological journey.
- **Emotional Connection:** Evokes pride and reflection among fans with clear representation of key victories and setbacks.
- **Data Efficiency:** Condenses large volumes of data spanning over 80 years into a compact and interpretable graph.

### **Weaknesses**
- **Readability Issues:** Dim gray text for years and opponents reduces clarity against the graph's background.
- **Cognitive Overload:** Extensive time span (1932–2015) challenges the working memory of viewers.
- **Inconsistent Axes:** Disparity in starting points for the "Home" and "Away" graphs causes confusion.
- **Lack of Axis Explanation:** Y-axis meaning is implied but not explicitly labeled.

## 🔧 Recommendations for Improvement

1. **Enhanced Contrast:** Use more distinct background and font colors to improve legibility.
2. **Chunking Data:** Break data into decades or key milestones to reduce cognitive overload.
3. **Uniform Axes:** Standardize the starting points for all visual elements to maintain consistency.
4. **Clear Labeling:** Explicitly define the Y-axis to improve interpretability.
5. **Bold Fonts:** Increase text size and weight for critical elements like years and opponent names.

## 🛠 Tools & Techniques Used

- **Theories Applied:**
  - **Edward Tufte's Principles:** Data-ink ratio for cleaner visuals.
  - **Cowan's Working Memory Theory (2001):** To identify and mitigate cognitive overload.
  - **Scott Berinato's Visualization Types:** Classified as everyday, data-driven, and declarative.
  - **Kahneman's Dual Process Theory:** System 2 thinking for analytical interpretation.
